Axiom of Extension: a set is determined by what its elements are-not the order in which they
                    might be listed or the fact that some elements might be listed more than
                    once.

Set-Builder Notation: The set with all the shapes such that the shapes are blue
{x | x = y}= set Builder Notation

{x | x >0}
{x E A | x^2=4}

Types of Sets:
-> Universal Set U
-> Empty Set -doesn't have anything in it
-> Singleton Set -only have one element
-> Finite Set -finite numbers of elements
-> Infinite Set -infinite numbers of elements
-> Subset - B is a subset of A set.

cardinal number of a set
A = set
n(A) = How many elements of this set
Equivalent set = same number of elements
Equal set: same elements

Subsets: If A and B are sets, then A is called a subset of B, written A.Subset(B),
        if and only if every element of A is also an element of B.
Proper Subsets: at least one more element that is not in A but in B.

Power Sets: Power set of A, denoted P(A), is the set of all Subsets of A.
Power sets is 2^n of its elements

Ordered Pairs: the elements order has to be the same
        Ordered n-tuples: (x1,x2,x3,x4,....,xn) = (y1,y2,y3,y4,.....,yn)
        (a,b) Ordered pair     Ordered 2-tuple
        (a,b,c) Ordered triple Ordered 3-tuple

Cartesian Product: Given sets A and B, the Cartesian Product of A and B, denoted
                  A*B and read "A cross B," is the set of all Ordered pairs(a,b),
                  where a is in A and b is in B
                  [A*B={(a,b)|aEA and bEB}]
